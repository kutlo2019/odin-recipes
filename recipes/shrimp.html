    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This shrimp risotto is full of warm, creamy goodness. It's topped with a bright and zesty lemon sauce similar to scampi. There’s also plenty of Parmesan cheese, garlic, and butter, which we know makes everything better. It feels fancy enough to be something you can serve at a dinner party but comforting and simple enough to enjoy on a weeknight.

        Risotto isn't a difficult dish to make—it just takes some patience. If you enjoy cooking, you may really enjoy the immersive quality of cooking risotto. Add the stock a little at a time and stir, stir, stir. As you stir the rice in the stock, the starch is released, and you'll be rewarded with a deliciously luxurious dish. Cooking the shrimp is quick and easy and can be done ahead of time. Just make sure to make the risotto right before you are ready to eat and serve it immediately.
